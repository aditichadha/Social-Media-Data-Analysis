# Social-Media-Data-Analysis

For this statistical analysis, we examined a generated social media dataset1 with the intention of discovering statistically significant answers to usage-, platform-, and interest-focused questions. The dataset consists of 1,000 entries containing user demographic information such as age, gender, interests, and social media platform utilized â€“ (just to name a few). Our goals were to identify any factors affecting the average time spent on social media as well as identifying any statistically significant differences within the demographic groups listed above. We formed our analysis and testing processes to be repeatable. That is, for a different social media dataset, once cleaned and formatted to match the one used here, the tests performed in this analysis could easily be implemented again and different conclusions could potentially be formed.
